# [hVision][project] help pages


The *hVision* help system uses simple HTML pages. Press **F1** in any graphical window to open the help page in the current directory, or in a "help" directory under or above the current one, with the same
name as the program executable and extension ".html". If this page does not exist, we try the
window name, or finally a default "help.html".

We can write the help files using markdown, LaTeX (Mathjax), and syntax highlighting of code samples (hscolour).
