pose estimation and tracking
----------------------------

- pose: simple pose estimation from an A4 sheet of paper

- augmented: adding a virtual object to the scene

- dynamic: the virtual object moves

- onlyRects: a camera combinator which "averages" all the rectangles found in the input sequence

- rectangles: metric rectification of a planar scene from a single rectangle and uncalibrated diag(f,f,1) camera.

- whiteboard: rectifies a white rectangle

- frontal: automatic metric rectification (from manually selected points) from several views (demo for BMVC)

- poseTracker: demo of camera pose estimation using ukf

- multipose: multicamera calibration using a planar reference

- ellipses: metric rectification of a planar scene from the images of two or more circles

- rightAngles: metric rectification of a planar scene from (manually selected) the images of right angles
