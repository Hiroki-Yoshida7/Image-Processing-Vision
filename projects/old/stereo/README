basic 3D reconstruction experiments
-----------------------------------

- multiview: 3D point detector from blue regions using multiple cameras calibrated with ../pose/multipose

- demostereo: autocalibration and 3D point detector from blue regions.

- vergence: demo of synthetic stereo rectification and distance measurement from a calibrated pair using ../pose/multipose

* stereo: epipolar geometry from manually selected points

* autostereo: automatic epipolar geometry
